//42.  Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magician’s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
function show_magicians(magicians) {
    magicians.forEach(function (magician) {
        console.log(magician);
    });
}
function make_great(magicians) {
    return magicians.map(function (magician) { return "the Great ".concat(magician); });
}
var magicians = ["Harry Houdini", "David Copperfield", "Penn Jillette", "Teller"];
magicians = make_great(magicians);
show_magicians(magicians);
